## Overview

Alkame-Nifty50 is an open-source, research-grade intraday signal engine for the NIFTY 50 index. It is built around four core design principles:

- **Risk-first**: `HOLD` with a reason is a valid — and often correct — output.
- **Calibration before confidence**: No signal confidence is ever surfaced until runtime calibration checks pass.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Trader overrides, notes, and feedback are first-class citizens of the pipeline.
- **Modular and API-first**: Every major component is independently testable and externally accessible via a REST API layer.

The full methodology, regulatory rationale, and business charter live in [`ALKAME_NIFTY50_CHARTER.md`](./ALKAME_NIFTY50_CHARTER.md). Read it first — it explains *why* the system is built the way it is.

This project is built and maintained by interns and mentors of the **[DBERT AI Internship Program](https://internship.dbert.online)** — see the [DBERT Internship Program](#dbert-internship-program) section below to get involved.

## What's New — Recent Improvements

This release significantly expands the system beyond the original signal pipeline.

### 🆕 REST API Layer (`api.py`)
A Flask-based REST API now exposes core engine capabilities over HTTP. Enables integration with external dashboards, bots, and automation workflows without touching internal Python code directly.

### 🆕 Scalping Engine (`scalping.py`)
Dedicated short-horizon scalping logic for high-frequency intraday opportunities on NIFTY 50 constituents. Works alongside the main prediction pipeline with its own risk guardrails.

### 🆕 Market Scanner (`scanner.py`)
A multi-stock scanner that sweeps all NIFTY 50 constituents on a configurable cadence and surfaces top-ranked opportunities based on ensemble signal strength, volume anomalies, and event context.

### 🆕 Position Planner (`position_planner.py`)
Translates raw BUY/SELL signals into actionable position plans — entry price, target, stop-loss, and position sizing — based on configurable capital and risk parameters.

### 🆕 Narrative Builder (`narrative_builder.py`)
Generates human-readable, plain-English summaries of each signal decision explaining *why* the engine recommends BUY, SELL, or HOLD — covering technical factors, macro events, sentiment, and calibration status.

### 🆕 Reference Level Engine (`reference_level_engine.py`)
Computes and maintains dynamic support/resistance reference levels (weekly pivots, prior-day high/low, VWAP anchors) used by the predictor, position planner, and dashboard.

### 🆕 System Health Monitor (`health_monitor.py`)
Always-on health checks tracking data feed freshness, model staleness, API quota consumption, and pipeline latency. Surfaces warnings before failures cascade into bad signals.

### 🆕 Automation Directory (`automation/`)
Shell and Python scripts for unattended scheduled operation — cron-friendly wrappers around `scheduler.py`, log rotation helpers, and restart-on-failure scripts for always-on Linux/EC2 deployment.

### ⚙️ Improved Scheduler (`scheduler.py`)
Major expansion: now coordinates scanner sweeps, health monitoring, scalping runs, and reference level updates — not just the core prediction loop. Supports graceful shutdown and configurable symbol subsets.

### ⚙️ Enhanced Predictor (`predictor.py`)
Now integrates reference levels and narrative generation directly into the output object. Each prediction result includes structural context and a human-readable explanation alongside the BUY/SELL/HOLD signal.

### ⚙️ Expanded Feature Engineer (`feature_engineer.py`)
Additional technical indicators including volume-weighted signals and multi-timeframe momentum features. Strict no-lookahead discipline maintained across all new additions.

### ⚙️ Richer History Manager (`history_manager.py`)
Expanded schema captures position plan data, narrative summaries, and health snapshots alongside predictions — improving post-hoc analysis and outcome tracking significantly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A free [marketaux](https://www.marketaux.com) API key
- *(Optional)* An [IMD API key](https://api.imd.gov.in) for live monsoon data

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

Set your API key as an environment variable. **Never hardcode keys into source files.**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export MARKETAUX_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set MARKETAUX_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:MARKETAUX_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

Without `IMD_API_KEY`, monsoon status falls back to manual entry via `macro_calendar.py`.

---

## Verification (Run Before First Use)

Each module includes a self-test. Run them in order to confirm your setup:

```bash
python config.py
python macro_calendar.py
python data_fetcher.py
python corporate_events_fetcher.py    # Run from a home/office connection — NSE blocks many cloud/VPN IPs
python news_sentiment_fetcher.py
python event_classifier.py
python global_risk_monitor.py
python reference_level_engine.py
python feature_engineer.py
python model_trainer.py
python ensemble_manager.py
python runtime_validator.py
python predictor.py
python position_planner.py
python narrative_builder.py
python scalping.py
python scanner.py
python human_insight_manager.py
python history_manager.py
python health_monitor.py
python backtester.py
python scheduler.py
python api.py                         # Starts the Flask REST API server
python app.py                         # Pure-logic self-test only; see Running section for dashboard
```

Each script prints `STATUS: PASS` or `STATUS: FAIL` at the end.

> **Note:** `data_fetcher.py`, `corporate_events_fetcher.py`, `news_sentiment_fetcher.py`, `global_risk_monitor.py`, `predictor.py`, and `scheduler.py` touch live external services and may take up to a minute or two.

---

## Running

**Terminal 1 — Signal Scheduler**

```bash
python scheduler.py
```

> Wire up `run_forever()` with a real `symbol_data_provider` callable (using `data_fetcher.py`) when ready for continuous operation. The integration point is intentionally left open — your symbol list, refresh cadence, and error-handling preferences for unattended operation are worth deciding deliberately.

**Terminal 2 — REST API Server**

```bash
python api.py
```

> Defaults to `http://localhost:5000`. Endpoints include signal retrieval, scanner results, health status, and prediction history. Refer to inline docstrings in `api.py` for full endpoint documentation. **Add API key middleware before any public or network-exposed deployment.**

**Terminal 3 — Dashboard**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Automated / Server Deployment**

```bash
# Use scripts in automation/ for unattended cron-based operation
# Example: run every 15 minutes during market hours
# */15 9-16 * * 1-5 /path/to/automation/run_scheduler.sh
```

## Known Limitations

- **NIFTY 50 constituent list** and sector map need verification against NSE's next semi-annual index review.
- **Festive-window dates** are approximate (lunar calendar shifts yearly) — verify each year.
- **Exchange holidays** are not yet modeled in `scheduler.is_market_open()` — it currently only checks weekday + time window.
- **`corporate_events_fetcher.py`** may be blocked from cloud/VPN IPs by NSE's bot protection — run from a normal home/office connection.
- **Scalping signals** carry inherently higher noise at very short timeframes; always validate against `runtime_validator.py` output before acting.
- **`api.py`** does not include authentication by default — add API key middleware before any public or network-exposed deployment.
